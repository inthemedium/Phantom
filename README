To build you will need:

- libxml2
- libprotobuf-c and protobufc toolchain
- libssl
- lpthread

This is all part of a current stable Debian distribution for example

first enter protos subdir and execute ./generate_protos.sh
second exectute make in src subdir

The scripts subdir contains a small tool to set up a tun device for phantom. The
source in there is modeled after Jeff Dike's tunctl program and explicitly not part of
phantom.

See src/test for the leftovers of my test setup network configuration - This
should give you some pointers on how to set up your own network for testing.
There is no easy way to do this yet.
